                <strong>M. Cookies</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                VEROHive uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an
                identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a
                web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The
                identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser
                requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either
                “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie
                will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its
                set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry
                date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the
                end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies
                do not typically contain any information that personally
                identifies a user, but personal information that we store about
                you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from
                session cookies.
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies—for
                example:
              </p>
              <p>
                a. in Internet Explorer (version 10) you can block cookies using
                the cookie handling override settings available by clicking
                “Tools,” “Internet Options,” “Privacy,” and then “Advanced”;
                <br />
                b. in Firefox (version 24) you can block all cookies by clicking
                “Tools,” “Options,” “Privacy,” selecting “Use custom settings
                for history” from the drop-down menu, and unticking “Accept
                cookies from sites”; and
                <br />
                c. in Chrome (version 29), you can block all cookies by
                accessing the “Customize and control” menu, and clicking
                “Settings,” “Show advanced settings,” and “Content settings,”
                and then selecting “Block sites from setting any data” under the
                “Cookies” heading. <br />
                d. Blocking all cookies will have a negative impact upon the
                usability of many websites. If you block cookies, you may not be
                able to use all the features on VEROHive. You can delete cookies
                already stored on your computer—for example:
                <br />
                e. in Internet Explorer (version 10), you must manually delete
                cookie files (you can find instructions for doing so at
                http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835 );
                <br />
                f. in Firefox (version 24), you can delete cookies by clicking
                “Tools,” “Options,” and “Privacy”, then selecting “Use custom
                settings for history”, clicking “Show Cookies,” and then
                clicking “Remove All Cookies”; and
                <br />
                g. in Chrome (version 29), you can delete all cookies by
                accessing the “Customize and control” menu, and clicking
                “Settings,” “Show advanced settings,” and “Clear browsing data,”
                and then selecting “Delete cookies and other site and plug-in
                data” before clicking “Clear browsing data.” Deleting cookies
                will have a negative impact on the usability of many websites.

                Services through an on-line registration page or an order form

                in any such additional terms and conditions applicable to the

                <br></br>
                7.2.1    Subscription Plan. The prices, features, and options of
                the VEROHIVE Services depend on the Subscription Plan selected
                as well as any changes instigated by Customer. VEROHIVE does not
                represent or warrant that a particular Subscription Plan will be
                offered indefinitely and reserves the right to change the prices
                for or alter the features and options in a particular
                Subscription Plan without prior notice.<br></br>
                <br></br>
                7.2.2    No Refunds. Customer will timely pay VEROHIVE all fees
                associated with its Subscription Plan, Account, or use of the
                VEROHIVE Services, including, but without limitation, by
                Authorized Users. CUSTOMER’S PAYMENTS ARE NON- REFUNDABLE EXCEPT
                AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS.<br></br>
                <br></br>
                 Charges for pre-paid Subscription Plans will be billed to
                Customer in advance. Charges for per-use purchases and standard
                Subscription Plan charges will be billed in arrears unless
                otherwise specified in the Subscription Plan.<br></br>
                <br></br>
                7.2.3    Recurring Charges. When you purchase a Subscription
                Plan, you must provide accurate and complete information for a
                valid payment method that you are authorized to use. You will be
                billed for your Subscription Plan either through the payment
                method you provide, such as a credit card, or through an
                intermediary provider such as iTunes, Google Play, or a similar
                app store (“App Store”). Customer must promptly notify VEROHIVE
                of any change in its invoicing address and must update its
                Account with any changes related to its payment method. BY
                COMPLETING REGISTRATION FOR A SUBSCRIPTION PLAN, CUSTOMER
                AUTHORIZES VEROHIVE OR ITS AGENT TO CHARGE ITS PAYMENT METHOD ON
                A RECURRING (E.G. MONTHLY OR YEARLY) BASIS (“AUTHORIZATION”)
                FOR:
                <br></br>
                <br></br> (a) THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION PLAN CHARGES;
                <br></br>
                <br></br> (b) ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE TAXES; AND
                <br></br>
                <br></br>(c) ANY OTHER CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH
                CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE VEROHIVE SERVICES. The Authorization
                continues through the applicable Subscription Term and any
                Renewal Term (as defined in Section 8.2.3, below) until Customer
                cancels as set forth in Section 8.2 of these Terms.   <br></br>
                <br></br>
                7.2.4    Late Fees &amp; Collection Costs. If VEROHIVE does not
                receive payment from Customer’s payment method, Customer agrees
                to pay all amounts due upon demand. Any amount not paid when due
                will be subject to finance charges equal to 1.5% of the unpaid
                balance per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable
                law, whichever is less, determined and compounded daily from the
                date due until the date paid. Customer will reimburse any costs
                or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable
                attorneys’ fees) incurred by VEROHIVE to collect any amount that
                is not paid when due. VEROHIVE may accept payment in any amount
                without prejudice to VEROHIVE’s right to recover the balance of
                the amount due or to pursue any other right or remedy. Amounts
                due to VEROHIVE may not be withheld or offset by Customer for
                any reason against amounts due or asserted to be due from
                VEROHIVE.<br></br>
                <br></br>
                7.2.5    Invoices. VEROHIVE will provide billing and usage
                information in a format we choose, which may change from time to
                time. VEROHIVE reserves the right to correct any errors or
                mistakes that it identifies even if it has already issued an
                invoice or received payment. Customer agrees to notify us about
                any billing problems or discrepancies within thirty (30) days
                after they first appear on your invoice. If Customer does not
                bring such problems/discrepancies to our attention within thirty
                (30) days, it agrees to waive its right to dispute such problems
                or discrepancies.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                7.2.6    Billing Cycles. Billing cycle end dates may change from
                time to time. When a billing cycle covers less than or more than
                a full month, we may make reasonable adjustments and/or
                prorations. Customer agrees that we may (at our option)
                accumulate charges incurred during a billing cycle and submit
                them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of a
                cycle, and that we may delay obtaining authorization or payment
                from Customer’s payment card issuer or App Store until
                submission of the accumulated charge(s). <br></br>
                <br></br>
                7.2.7    Benefit Programs. You may receive or be eligible for
                certain pricing structures, discounts, features, promotions, and
                other benefits (collectively, &quot;Benefits&quot;) through a
                business or government agreement with us (&quot;Business

                VEROHIVE Services and a business or government entity pays your
                charges or is otherwise liable for the charges, you authorize us
                to share your account information with that entity and/or its
                authorized agents. If you are enrolled in a Subscription Plan or
                receive certain Benefits tied to Business Terms with us, but you
                are liable for your own charges, then you authorize us to share
                enough account information to verify your continuing eligibility
                for those Benefits and the Subscription Plan.<br></br>

                and penalties thereon, excluding taxes based on VEROHIVE’s net
                income (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer shall be responsible
                for and bear Taxes associated with its purchase of, payment for,
                access to or use of the VEROHIVE Services. Taxes shall not be

                <br></br>
                amount payable as necessary so that after making all required
                deductions and withholdings, VEROHIVE receives and retains (free
                from any Tax liability) an amount equal to the amount it would
                have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.
                Customer hereby confirms that VEROHIVE can rely on the name and
                address set forth in its registration for a Subscription Plan as

                Customer’s obligations under this Section 7.2.8 (Tax
                Responsibility) shall survive the termination or expiration of

                <br></br>
                7.2.9    Intermediary Provider Billing. If your Subscription
                Plan is based on intermediary provider billing, your
                intermediary provider will automatically charge your App Store
                account monthly for the cost of the Subscription Plan and any
                applicable taxes. If you are not current with your Subscription
                Plan payments, we reserve the right to terminate your account,
                suspend your access to your Subscription Plan, or convert your
                Subscription Plan subscription to a non-subscription account.
                You will be responsible for paying all past due amounts.

                <br></br>
                <br></br> (a) it has all requisite rights and authority to use
                the VEROHIVE Services under these Terms and to grant all

                <br></br>(e) it agrees that VEROHIVE will not be liable for any
                losses incurred as a result of a third party&#39;s use of its

                <br></br> (f) it will use the VEROHIVE Services for lawful

                accurate, and correct; and<br></br>
                <br></br> (h) it will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to

                <br></br>
                7.6.1    Confidential Information. “Confidential Information”
                means <br></br>
                <br></br>(a) for VEROHIVE, the VEROHIVE Services and
                Documentation;
                <br></br>
                <br></br> (b) for Customer, Customer Data;<br></br>
                <br></br> (c) any other information of a party that is disclosed
                in writing or orally and is designated as confidential or
                proprietary at the time of disclosure (and, in the case of oral
                disclosures, summarized in writing within thirty (30) days of
                the initial disclosure and delivered to the Recipient), or that
                due to the nature of the information the Recipient would clearly
                understand it to be confidential information of the disclosing
                party; and<br></br>
                <br></br> (d) the specific terms and conditions of these Terms,
                and any amendment and attachment thereof, between the parties.
                Confidential Information shall not include any information that:
                <br></br>
                <br></br> (i) was or becomes generally known to the public
                through no fault or breach of these Terms by the Recipient;{" "}
                <br></br>
                <br></br>(ii) was rightfully in the Recipient’s possession at
                the time of disclosure without restriction on use or disclosure;
                <br></br>
                <br></br> (iii) was independently developed by the Recipient
                without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information;
                or <br></br>
                <br></br>(iv) was rightfully obtained by the Recipient from a
                third party not under a duty of confidentiality and without
                restriction on use or disclosure. All information provided to
                VEROHIVE that is not Confidential Information will be treated in
                accordance with the VEROHIVE Privacy Policy. 7.6.2    Restricted
                Use and Nondisclosure. During and after the Subscription Term,
                the party receiving Confidential Information (“Recipient”) will:{" "}
                <br></br>
                <br></br>(a) use the Confidential Information of the other party
                solely for the purpose for which it is provided; <br></br>
                <br></br>(b) not disclose such Confidential Information to a
                third party, except on a need-to-know basis to its attorneys,
                auditors, consultants, and service providers who are under
                confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those
                contained herein; and <br></br>
                <br></br>(c) protect such Confidential Information from
                unauthorized use and disclosure to the same extent (but using no
                less than a reasonable degree of care) that it protects its own
                Confidential Information of a similar nature. Notwithstanding
                the foregoing, Customer expressly authorizes VEROHIVE to use and
                process Customer Data as described in the VEROHIVE Privacy
                Policy, which provides for, but is not limited to, delivering
                services as indicated by Customer’s use of the VEROHIVE Services
                and sharing Transaction Data with individuals who are authorized
                to view or participate in video meetings created by you.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                7.6.3    Required Disclosure. If VEOHIVE is required by law to
                disclose Confidential Information, VEROHIVE will give prompt
                written notice to Customer before making the disclosure, unless
                prohibited from doing so by the legal or administrative process,
                and assist Customer to obtain where reasonably available an
                order protecting the Confidential Information from public
                disclosure. 7.6.4    Ownership. Notwithstanding any other
                provision of these Terms, VEROHIVE acknowledges that, as between
                the parties, all Confidential Information it receives from
                Customer, including all copies thereof in Recipient’s possession
                or control, in any media, is proprietary to and exclusively
                owned by Customer. Nothing in these Terms grants VEROHIVE any
                right, title or interest in or to any of the Customer’s
                Confidential Information. VEROHIVE’s incorporation of the
                disclosing party’s Confidential Information into any of its own
                materials will not render Confidential Information
                non-confidential. 8.        TERM AND TERMINATION 8.1      
                Termination – Site Visitors. A Site Visitor may terminate its
                use of the Site at any time by ceasing further use of the Site.
                VEROHIVE may terminate your use of the Site and deny you access
                to the Site in our sole discretion for any reason or no reason,
                including for violation of these Terms. 8.2       Term and
                Termination – Customers. 8.2.1    Suspension of Access to
                VEROHIVE Services. VEROHIVE may suspend any use of the VEROHIVE
                Services, remove any content or disable or terminate any Account
                or Authorized User that VEROHIVE reasonably and in good faith
                believes violates these Terms. VEROHIVE will use commercially
                reasonable efforts to notify you prior to any such suspension or
                disablement, unless VEROHIVE reasonably believes that: (a) it is
                prohibited from doing so under applicable law or under legal
                process, such as court or government administrative agency
                processes, orders, mandates, and the like; or (b) it is
                necessary to delay notice in order to prevent imminent harm to
                the VEROHIVE Services or a third party. Under circumstances
                where notice is delayed, VEROHIVE will provide the notice if and
                when the related restrictions in the previous sentence no longer
                apply. 8.2.2    Term. The period of effectiveness of these Terms
                (“Term”), with respect to VEROHIVE Services, begins on the date
                the Customer accepts it and continues until the Customer’s
                Subscription Plan expires or its use of the VEROHIVE Services
                ceases (including as a result of termination in accordance with
                this Section 8.2), whichever is later. 8.2.3    Subscription
                Term and Automatic Renewals. VEROHIVE’s Subscription Plans
                automatically renew unless otherwise noted. If you purchase a
                Subscription Plan you agree to pay the then-current applicable
                fee associated with the Subscription Plan and further agree and
                acknowledge that it will automatically renew, unless, prior to
                the end of the current period of effectiveness of the
                Subscription Plan (“Subscription Term”): (a) you terminate your
                Account; (b) you set your Account not to auto-renew by logging
                in to VEROHIVE Services or contacting us here: privacytos at
                verohive.com; (c) VEROHIVE declines to renew your Subscription
                Plan; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as
                expressly permitted herein. The Subscription Plan will
                automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis, depending on
                the method you choose (“Renewal Term”). Promotional codes may
                only be used for your first Subscription Term. If you purchased
                your Subscription Plan with a promotional code, each time your
                Subscription Plan renews you will be charged the full annual
                billing amount. If your Subscription Plan is ever terminated for
                any reason, and you purchase another Subscription Plan, you
                shall not be eligible to use a promotional code. We reserve the
                right to modify, terminate, or otherwise amend the fees and
                features associated with your Subscription Plan. We may also
                recommend that you purchase a new Subscription Plan that is
                comparable to your previous Subscription Plan that is ending.
                Before we change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees
                and charges, we will give you advance notice of at least thirty
                (30) days. If we provide you such advance notice, your continued
                use of the VEROHIVE Services after the changes have been made
                will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not
                wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you
                may terminate your Subscription Plan as described in Section
                8.2.4. If you accept the new Subscription Plan, its terms and
                conditions with these Terms will apply in the Renewal Term and
                thereafter. 8.2.4    Termination by Customer. You may terminate
                your Account at any time upon ten (10) days’ advance written
                notice to VEROHIVE. If you wish to terminate, you must provide
                notice by contacting privacytos at verohive.com. If you
                purchased your Subscription Plan through an external service,
                such as an App Store, you must use the tools made available by
                those services to manage and/or terminate your Subscription
                Plan. Section 7.2.2 notwithstanding, if a Customer terminates
                its annual Subscription Plan within the first thirty (30) days
                of the initial Subscription Term, it may submit a written
                request to VEROHIVE for a refund of the fees paid to VEROHIVE
                for the initial Subscription Term, which VEROHIVE will consider,
                without obligation, in good faith. VEROHIVE has no obligation to
                consider refund requests related to a termination of a
                Subscription Plan if the termination does not occur in the first
                thirty (30) days of the initial Subscription Term, or if there
                has been a violation of other Terms herein, or if records
                indicate substantial productive use took place during that
                period. 8.2.5    Default; Termination by VEROHIVE. A Customer
                will be in default of these Terms if: (a) it fails to timely pay
                any amount owed to us or an Affiliate of ours; (b) it or an
                Authorized User associated with its Account breaches any
                provision of these Terms or violates any published policy
                applicable to the VEROHIVE Services; (c) it is or becomes
                subject to any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or similar
                laws; or (d) if, in our sole discretion, we believe that
                continued use of the VEROHIVE Services by the Customer (or its
                Authorized Users or signers) creates legal risk for VEROHIVE or
                presents a threat to the security of the VEROHIVE Services or
                VEROHIVE’s customers. If a Customer is in default, we may,
                without notice: (i) suspend its Account and use of the VEROHIVE
                Services; (ii) terminate its Account; (iii) charge reactivation
                fees in order to reactivate its Account; and (iv) pursue any
                other remedy available to us. A VEROHIVE “Affiliate” means any
                legal entity that Megahoot, LLC. owns, that owns VEROHIVE. or
                that is under common control with VEROHIVE, Inc.  A Customer
                “Affiliate” means any legal entity that Customer owns, that owns
                Customer or that is under common control with Customer.
                “Control” and “own” mean possessing greater than 50% interest in
                an entity or the right to direct the management of the entity.
                8.2.6    Effect of Termination. If these Terms expires or are
                terminated for any reason: (a) Customer will pay to VEROHIVE any
                amounts that have accrued before, and remain unpaid as of, the
                date of the termination or expiration, including those for the
                billing cycle in which termination occurs; (b) any and all of
                Customer’s liabilities to VEROHIVE that have accrued before the
                effective date of the expiration or termination will survive;
                (c) licenses and use rights granted to Customer with respect to
                the Site and VEROHIVE Services and intellectual property will
                immediately terminate; (d) VEROHIVE’s obligation to provide any
                further services to Customer under these Terms will immediately
                terminate, except any such services that are expressly to be
                provided following expiration or termination of these Terms; and
                (e) the provisions of Section 3 (Usage and Access Rights),

                (Indemnification Obligations), Section 11 (Limitations of
                Liability), and Section 12 (General) will survive, as well as

                OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE
                AVAILABLE VIA VEROHIVE SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE. YOU
                WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE OR PASS ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR
                WARRANTY ON BEHALF OF VEROHIVE TO ANY THIRD PARTY. BECAUSE SOME
                STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED
                WARRANTIES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT
                EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
                PERMITTED BY AND FOR THE MINIMUM WARRANTY PERIOD ALLOWED BY THE
                MANDATORY APPLICABLE LAW. If you are a California resident, you
                hereby waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general
                release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not
                know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing
                the release, which if known by him must have materially affected
                his settlement with the debtor.” This release includes the
                criminal acts of others. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
                exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion
                of liability for incidental or consequential damages such as in
                this Section 9 or below in Section 11. Accordingly, some of
                these limitations may not apply to you. If you are a New Jersey
                resident, or a resident of another state that permits the
                exclusion of these warranties and liabilities, then the
                limitations in Section 9 and Section 11 specifically do apply to
                you. 10.     INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS You will defend,
                indemnify, and hold us, our Affiliates, officers, directors,
                employees, suppliers, consultants, and agents harmless from any
                and all third-party claims, liability, damages, and costs
                (including, but not limited to, attorneys&#39; fees) arising
                from or related to, as applicable: (a) your access to and use of
                the Site; (b) violation of these Terms by you or your Account
                Administrator(s) or Authorized Users, as applicable; (c)
                infringement of any intellectual property or other right of any
                person or entity by you; (d) the nature and content of all
                Customer Data processed by the VEROHIVE Services; or (e)  any
                products or services purchased or obtained by you in connection
                with the Site. VEROHIVE retains the exclusive right to settle,
                compromise, and pay, without your prior consent, any and all
                claims or causes of action that are brought against us. We
                reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive
                defense and control of any matter for which you are required to
                indemnify us and you agree to cooperate with our defense of
                these claims. You agree not to settle any matter in which we are
                named as a defendant and/or for which you have indemnity
                obligations without our prior written consent. We will use
                reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or
                proceeding upon becoming aware of it. 11.     LIMITATIONS OF
                LIABILITY 11.1     Disclaimer of Consequential
                Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN
                THESE TERMS, VEROHIVE WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE
                LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, COVER,
                PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
                TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
                LIMITED TO, GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, OR LOSS OF
                BUSINESS, EVEN IF APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH LOSSES, AND
                WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE MADE BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
                NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
                PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE VEROHIVE
                PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
                SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING
                FROM ANY: (a) USE OF THE SITE, DOCUMENTATION, OR VEROHIVE
                SERVICES; (b) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (c)
                PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER
                RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE,
                DOCUMENTATION, OR VEROHIVE SERVICES; (d) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
                TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION
                AND/OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN; (e) ANY
                INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR
                SERVERS; (f) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT
                MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE SITE, DOCUMENTATION, OR
                VEROHIVE SERVICES BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (g) ANY LOSS OF YOUR DATA
                OR CONTENT FROM THE SITE, DOCUMENTATION, OR VEROHIVE SERVICES;
                (h) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR
                DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF ANY
                CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE
                SITE, DOCUMENTATION, OR VEROHIVE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON
                WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER
                LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE VEROHIVE PARTIES ARE
                ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND/OR (i) THE
                DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS OR OUR PRIVACY
                POLICY. Some countries and jurisdictions do not allow the
                limitation or exclusion of consequential, direct, indirect, or
                other damages in contracts with consumers and to the extent you
                are a consumer the limitations or exclusions in this Section
                11.1 may not apply to you. 11.2     Cap on Damages. OUR TOTAL
                LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
                RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE (INCLUDING
                WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND
                REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT,
                TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE
                THEORY, WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO VEROHIVE
                FOR THE VEROHIVE SERVICE(S) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM UNDER THESE
                TERMS DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE OF
                THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, OR $100, WHICEVER IS
                GREATER. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM SHALL NOT ENLARGE
                THIS LIMIT. 11.3     Independent Allocations of Risk. Each
                provision of these Terms that provides for a limitation of
                liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages
                represents an agreed allocation of the risks of these Terms
                between the parties. This allocation is an essential element of
                the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these
                provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions
                of these Terms, and each of these provisions will apply even if
                the warranties in these Terms have failed of their essential
                purpose. 11.4    Jurisdictional Limitations.  11.4.1  Because
                some states and jurisdictions do not allow limitation of
                liability in certain instances, portions of the above limitation
                may not apply to you. In that event, such exclusions and
                limitations shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by
                applicable mandatory law (and our liability shall be limited or
                excluded as permitted under mandatory applicable law). If you
                are a New Jersey resident, the limitations in Section 11
                specifically do apply to you. 11.4.2  VEROHIVE’s liability to
                you if you are domiciled in Germany is limited as described in
                Section 12.9 below. 12.      GENERAL     12.1     Third Party
                Content. We may provide. VEROHIVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
                CONTENT ON THE INTERNET OR WEB PAGES THAT ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE
                THE SITE OR POSTS OF USER CONTENT. Your correspondence or
                business dealings with, or participation in promotions of,
                advertisers or partners found on or through the Site, including
                payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other
                terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated
                with such dealings, are solely between you and such advertiser
                or partner. You agree that we are not responsible or liable for
                any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any
                such dealings or as the result of the presence of such
                advertisers or links to third-party web sites or resources on
                the Site. 12.2     Relationship. At all times, you and VEROHIVE
                are independent contractors, and are not the agents or
                representatives of the other. These Terms are not intended to
                create a joint venture, partnership, or franchise relationship
                between the parties. Non- parties do not benefit from and cannot
                enforce these Terms. There are no third-party beneficiaries to
                these Terms. You must not represent to anyone that you are an
                agent of VEROHIVE or are otherwise authorized to bind or commit
                VEROHIVE in any way without VEROHIVE’s prior written
                authorization. 12.3     EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You acknowledge
                that the Services, or portion thereof may be subject to the
                export control laws of the United States and other applicable
                country export control and trade sanctions laws (“Export Control
                and Sanctions Laws”). You and your End Users may not access,
                use, export, re-export, divert, transfer or disclose any portion
                of the Services or any related technical information or
                materials, directly or indirectly, in violation of any
                applicable export control or trade sanctions law or regulation.
                You represent and warrant that (i) You and your End Users are
                not citizens of, or located within, a country or territory that
                is subject to U.S. trade sanctions or other significant trade
                restrictions (including without limitation Cuba, Iran, North
                Korea, Syria, and the Crimea) and that you and your End Users
                will not access or use the Services, or export, re-export,
                divert, or transfer the Services, in or to such countries or
                territories; (ii) You and your End Users are not identified on
                any U.S. government restricted party lists (including without
                limitation the U.S. Treasury Department’s List of Specially
                Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons and Foreign Sanctions
                Evaders List, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Parties
                List, Entity List, and Unverified List, and the U.S. Department
                of State proliferation-related lists); and (iii) that no Content
                created or submitted by you or your End Users is subject to any
                restriction on disclosure, transfer, download, export or
                re-export under the Export Control Laws. You are solely
                responsible for complying with the Export Control Laws and
                monitoring them for any modifications. 12.4 NO HIGH RISK USE.
                The Services are not designed or licensed for use in hazardous
                environments requiring fail-safe controls, including without
                limitation operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft
                navigation/communication systems, air traffic control, and life
                support or weapons systems. The Services shall not be used for
                or in any HIGH RISK environment.  12.5     Assignability. You
                may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms
                without VEROHIVE’s prior written consent. If consent is given,
                these Terms will bind your successors and assigns. Any attempt
                by you to transfer your rights, duties, or obligations under
                these Terms except as expressly provided in these Terms is
                void. VEROHIVE may freely assign its rights, duties, and
                obligations under these Terms. 12.6      Notices. Except as
                otherwise permitted by these Terms, any notice required or
                permitted to be given in connection with the VEROHIVE Services

                VEROHIVE, with a copy, in the case of VEROHIVE, to
                privacypolicytos at verohive.com. Customer or VEROHIVE may
                change its address for receipt of notice by notice to the other
                party in accordance with this Section 12. Notices are deemed
                given upon receipt if delivered using VEROHIVE Services, two (2)
                business days following the date of mailing, or one (1) business
                day following delivery to a courier. 12.7      Force
                Majeure. Except for any payment obligations, neither you nor
                VEROHIVE will be liable for failure to perform any obligation
                under these Terms to the extent such failure is caused by a
                force majeure event (including acts of God, natural disasters,
                war, civil disturbance, action by governmental entity, strike,
                and other causes beyond the party’s reasonable control). The
                party affected by the force majeure event will provide notice to
                the other party within a commercially reasonable time and will
                use commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance as
                soon as practicable. Obligations not performed due to a force
                majeure event will be performed as soon as reasonably possible
                when the force majeure event concludes. 12.8 INJUNCTIVE
                RELIEF. You acknowledge that any use of the Services contrary to
                this Agreement, or any transfer, sublicensing, copying or
                disclosure of technical information or materials related to the
                Services, may cause irreparable injury to VEROHIVE, its
                Affiliates, suppliers and any other party authorized by VEROHIVE
                to resell, distribute, or promote the Services
                (&quot;Resellers&quot;), and under such circumstances VEROHIVE,
                its Affiliates, suppliers and Resellers will be entitled to
                equitable relief, without posting bond or other security,
                including, but not limited to, preliminary and permanent
                injunctive relief. 12.9     Mandatory Arbitration, Waiver of
                Class Actions Applicable to Customers.  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION
                CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO
                FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. 12.7.1 You agree that these Terms
                affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act
                governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration
                provisions. This Section 12.7 is intended to be interpreted
                broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including
                but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any
                aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in
                contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other
                legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior;
                and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
                The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the
                litigation of certain intellectual property as provided below.
                12.7.2 Initial Dispute Resolution. Most disputes can be resolved
                without resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us,
                you agree that before taking any formal action you will contact
                us at privacypolicytos at verohive.com provide a brief, written
                description of the dispute and your contact information
                (including your username, if your dispute relates to an
                Account). Except for intellectual property, you and VEROHIVE
                agree to use their reasonable efforts to settle any dispute,
                claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation
                with VEROHIVE, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition
                to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. 12.7.3
                Arbitrator’s Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state,
                or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
                resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the
                interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of
                these Terms, including but not limited to any claim that all or
                any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is
                subject to arbitration or the question of waiver by litigation
                conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever
                relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The
                arbitrator&#39;s award shall be written and shall be binding on
                the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of
                competent jurisdiction. 12.7.4 Filing a Demand. To start an
                arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for
                Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the
                amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a
                Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (b) Send three
                copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate
                filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San
                Francisco California 94111; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand
                for Arbitration to us at:privacypolicytos at verohive.com.
                12.7.5 No Jury Trial. The parties understand that, absent this
                mandatory arbitration section, they would have the right to sue
                in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in
                some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs
                of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in
                arbitration than in court. 12.7.6 Venue. Arbitration shall be
                initiated and take place in Delaware, United States, and you and
                VEROHIVE agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any
                federal or state court in Delaware in order to compel
                arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
                confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered
                by the arbitrator. 12.7.7 Class Action Waiver. The parties
                further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the
                party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class
                action or other representative action, and the parties expressly
                waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a
                class basis. YOU AND VEROHIVE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
                AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
                NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines
                that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void
                or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can
                proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set
                forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and
                the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate
                disputes. 12.7.8 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual
                Property. Notwithstanding the parties&#39; decision to resolve
                all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring
                enforcement actions, validity determinations, or claims arising
                from or relating to theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of
                intellectual property in any state or federal court with
                jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to
                protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property
                rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and
                trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). 12.7.9
                Survival. This Mandatory Arbitration, Waiver of Class Actions
                section shall survive any termination of your use of the Site.
                12.8     Entire Terms. These Terms, which include the language
                and paragraphs preceding Section 1, are the final, complete, and
                exclusive expression of the agreement between you and VEROHIVE
                regarding the VEROHIVE Services provided under these
                Terms. These Terms supersede and the parties disclaim any
                reliance on previous oral and written communications (including
                any confidentiality agreements pertaining to the VEROHIVE
                Services under these Terms) with respect to the subject matter
                hereof and apply to the exclusion of any other terms that you
                seek to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade,
                custom, practice or course of dealing. VEROHIVE hereby rejects
                any additional or conflicting terms appearing in a purchase
                order or any other ordering materials submitted by Customer and
                conditions assent solely based on these Terms and conditions of
                these Terms as offered by VEROHIVE. Except as explicitly
                permitted in these Terms, no modification or amendment of these
                Terms shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by
                an authorized agent of the party against whom the modification
                or amendment is being asserted. In the event of an inconsistency
                or conflict, the order of precedence in descending order of
                control is as follows: (a) the Subscription Plan; (b) any
                attachments or appendix(ices) to the Service Schedule(s); (c)
                the Service Schedule; and (d) these Terms.  12.9   Governing Law
                &amp; Venue. These Terms will be interpreted, construed, and
                enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of
                the State of Delaware, U.S.A., without reference to its choice
                of law rules to the contrary. For purposes of determining the
                governing law, you and VEROHIVE agree that VEROHIVE is the
                proponent of these Terms. Notwithstanding Customer’s and
                VEROHIVE’s agreement to mandatory arbitration, either party may
                seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from a court
                of competent jurisdiction in Delaware, as necessary to protect
                the party&#39;s rights or property pending the completion of
                arbitration. Customer and VEROHIVE submit to the exclusive
                jurisdiction of, and venue in, any federal or state court of
                competent jurisdiction located in Delaware, U.S.A.
                12.10   Language and Translations. VEROHIVE may provide
                translations of these Terms or other terms or
                policies. Translations are provided for informational purposes
                and if there is an inconsistency or conflict between a
                translation and the English version, the English version will
                control. 12.11 Waiver. The waiver by either you or VEROHIVE of
                any breach of any provision of these Terms does not waive any
                other breach. The failure of any party to these Terms to insist
                on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in
                accordance with these Terms will not be a waiver of such party’s
                right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the
                same be construed as a novation of these Terms. 12.12  
                Severability. If any part of these Terms is found to be illegal,
                unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of these Terms
                will remain in full force and effect. If any material limitation
                or restriction on the grant of any license to you under these
                Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the
                license will immediately terminate. 12.13 General
                Provisions. This Agreement embodies the entire understanding and
                agreement between the Parties respecting the subject matter of
                this Agreement and supersedes any and all prior understandings
                and agreements between the Parties respecting such subject
                matter, except that if you or your company have executed a
                separate written agreement or you have signed an order form
                referencing a separate agreement governing your use of the
                Services, then such agreement shall control to the extent that
                any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the terms of such
                agreement. VEROHIVE may elect to change or supplement the terms
                of this Agreement from time to time at its sole discretion.
                VEROHIVE will exercise commercially reasonable business efforts
                to provide notice to you of any material changes to this
                Agreement. Within ten (10) business days of posting changes to
                this Agreement (or ten (10) business days from the date of
                notice, if such is provided), they will be binding on you. If
                you do not agree with the changes, You should discontinue using
                the Services. If you continue using the Services after such ten-
                business-day period, You will be deemed to have accepted the
                changes to the terms of this Agreement. In order to participate
                in certain Services, You may be notified that you are required
                to download software and/or agree to additional terms and
                conditions. Unless expressly set forth in such additional terms
                and conditions, those additional terms are hereby incorporated
                into this Agreement. This Agreement has been prepared in the
                English Language and such version shall be controlling in all
                respects and any non-English version of this Agreement is solely
                for accommodation purposes.
