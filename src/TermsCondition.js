            <br></br>
            7.2.3    Recurring Charges. When you purchase a Subscription Plan,
            you must provide accurate and complete information for a valid
            payment method that you are authorized to use. You will be billed
            for your Subscription Plan either through the payment method you
            provide, such as a credit card, or through an intermediary provider
            such as iTunes, Google Play, or a similar app store (“App Store”).
            Customer must promptly notify VEROHIVE of any change in its
            invoicing address and must update its Account with any changes
            related to its payment method. BY COMPLETING REGISTRATION FOR A
            SUBSCRIPTION PLAN, CUSTOMER AUTHORIZES VEROHIVE OR ITS AGENT TO
            CHARGE ITS PAYMENT METHOD ON A RECURRING (E.G. MONTHLY OR YEARLY)
            BASIS (“AUTHORIZATION”) FOR:
            <br></br>
            <br></br> (a) THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION PLAN CHARGES;
            <br></br>
            <br></br> (b) ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE TAXES; AND
            <br></br>
            <br></br>(c) ANY OTHER CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH
            CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE VEROHIVE SERVICES. The Authorization continues
            through the applicable Subscription Term and any Renewal Term (as
            defined in Section 8.2.3, below) until Customer cancels as set forth
            in Section 8.2 of these Terms.   <br></br>
            <br></br>
            7.2.4    Late Fees &amp; Collection Costs. If VEROHIVE does not
            receive payment from Customer’s payment method, Customer agrees to
            pay all amounts due upon demand. Any amount not paid when due will
            be subject to finance charges equal to 1.5% of the unpaid balance
            per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever
            is less, determined and compounded daily from the date due until the
            date paid. Customer will reimburse any costs or expenses (including,
            but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by VEROHIVE
            to collect any amount that is not paid when due. VEROHIVE may accept
            payment in any amount without prejudice to VEROHIVE’s right to
            recover the balance of the amount due or to pursue any other right
            or remedy. Amounts due to VEROHIVE may not be withheld or offset by
            Customer for any reason against amounts due or asserted to be due
            from VEROHIVE.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            7.2.5    Invoices. VEROHIVE will provide billing and usage
            information in a format we choose, which may change from time to
            time. VEROHIVE reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes
            that it identifies even if it has already issued an invoice or
            received payment. Customer agrees to notify us about any billing
            problems or discrepancies within thirty (30) days after they first
            appear on your invoice. If Customer does not bring such
            problems/discrepancies to our attention within thirty (30) days, it
            agrees to waive its right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            7.2.6    Billing Cycles. Billing cycle end dates may change from
            time to time. When a billing cycle covers less than or more than a
            full month, we may make reasonable adjustments and/or
            prorations. Customer agrees that we may (at our option) accumulate
            charges incurred during a billing cycle and submit them as one or
            more aggregate charges during or at the end of a cycle, and that we
            may delay obtaining authorization or payment from Customer’s payment
            card issuer or App Store until submission of the accumulated
            charge(s). <br></br>
            <br></br>
            7.2.7    Benefit Programs. You may receive or be eligible for
            certain pricing structures, discounts, features, promotions, and
            other benefits (collectively, &quot;Benefits&quot;) through a
            business or government agreement with us (&quot;Business
            Terms&quot;). Any and all such Benefits are provided solely as a
            result of the corresponding Business Terms and such Benefits may be
            modified or terminated without notice. If you use the VEROHIVE
            Services and a business or government entity pays your charges or is
            otherwise liable for the charges, you authorize us to share your
            account information with that entity and/or its authorized
            agents. If you are enrolled in a Subscription Plan or receive
            certain Benefits tied to Business Terms with us, but you are liable
            for your own charges, then you authorize us to share enough account
            information to verify your continuing eligibility for those Benefits
            and the Subscription Plan.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            7.2.8    Tax Responsibility. All payments required by these Terms
            are stated exclusive of all taxes, duties, levies, imposts, fines,
            or similar governmental assessments, including sales and use taxes,
            value-added taxes (“VAT”), goods and services taxes (“GST”), excise,
            business, service, and similar transactional taxes imposed by any
            jurisdiction and the interest and penalties thereon, excluding taxes
            based on VEROHIVE’s net income (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer
            shall be responsible for and bear Taxes associated with its purchase
            of, payment for, access to or use of the VEROHIVE Services. Taxes
            shall not be deducted from the payments to VEROHIVE, except as
            required by law, in which case Customer shall increase the<br></br>
            <br></br>
            amount payable as necessary so that after making all required
            deductions and withholdings, VEROHIVE receives and retains (free
            from any Tax liability) an amount equal to the amount it would have
            received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. Customer
            hereby confirms that VEROHIVE can rely on the name and address set
            forth in its registration for a Subscription Plan as being the place
            of supply for Tax purposes. VEROHIVE’s and Customer’s obligations
            under this Section 7.2.8 (Tax Responsibility) shall survive the
            termination or expiration of these Terms.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            7.2.9    Intermediary Provider Billing. If your Subscription Plan is
            based on intermediary provider billing, your intermediary provider
            will automatically charge your App Store account monthly for the
            cost of the Subscription Plan and any applicable taxes. If you are
            not current with your Subscription Plan payments, we reserve the
            right to terminate your account, suspend your access to your
            Subscription Plan, or convert your Subscription Plan subscription to
            a non-subscription account. You will be responsible for paying all
            past due amounts.<br></br>
            <br></br>

            Customer hereby represents and warrants to VEROHIVE that:<br></br>
            <br></br> (a) it has all requisite rights and authority to use the

            <br></br> (d) it agrees to immediately notify VEROHIVE of any
            unauthorized use of Customer’s Account of which it becomes aware;{" "}
            <br></br>
            <br></br>(e) it agrees that VEROHIVE will not be liable for any
            losses incurred as a result of a third party&#39;s use of its
            Account, regardless of whether such use is with or without its

            <br></br>
            7.6.1    Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means{" "}
            <br></br>
            <br></br>(a) for VEROHIVE, the VEROHIVE Services and Documentation;
            <br></br>
            <br></br> (b) for Customer, Customer Data;<br></br>
            <br></br> (c) any other information of a party that is disclosed in
            writing or orally and is designated as confidential or proprietary
            at the time of disclosure (and, in the case of oral disclosures,
            summarized in writing within thirty (30) days of the initial
            disclosure and delivered to the Recipient), or that due to the
            nature of the information the Recipient would clearly understand it
            to be confidential information of the disclosing party; and<br></br>
            <br></br> (d) the specific terms and conditions of these Terms, and
            any amendment and attachment thereof, between the parties.
            Confidential Information shall not include any information that:
            <br></br>
            <br></br> (i) was or becomes generally known to the public through
            no fault or breach of these Terms by the Recipient; <br></br>
            <br></br>(ii) was rightfully in the Recipient’s possession at the
            time of disclosure without restriction on use or disclosure;
            <br></br>
            <br></br> (iii) was independently developed by the Recipient without
            use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or <br></br>
            <br></br>(iv) was rightfully obtained by the Recipient from a third
            party not under a duty of confidentiality and without restriction on
            use or disclosure. All information provided to VEROHIVE that is not
            Confidential Information will be treated in accordance with the
            VEROHIVE Privacy Policy. 7.6.2    Restricted Use and
            Nondisclosure. During and after the Subscription Term, the party
            receiving Confidential Information (“Recipient”) will: <br></br>
            <br></br>(a) use the Confidential Information of the other party
            solely for the purpose for which it is provided; <br></br>
            <br></br>(b) not disclose such Confidential Information to a third
            party, except on a need-to-know basis to its attorneys, auditors,
            consultants, and service providers who are under confidentiality
            obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein; and{" "}
            <br></br>
            <br></br>(c) protect such Confidential Information from unauthorized
            use and disclosure to the same extent (but using no less than a
            reasonable degree of care) that it protects its own Confidential
            Information of a similar nature. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            Customer expressly authorizes VEROHIVE to use and process Customer
            Data as described in the VEROHIVE Privacy Policy, which provides
            for, but is not limited to, delivering services as indicated by
            Customer’s use of the VEROHIVE Services and sharing Transaction Data
            with individuals who are authorized to view or participate in video
            meetings created by you.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            7.6.3    Required Disclosure. If VEOHIVE is required by law to
            disclose Confidential Information, VEROHIVE will give prompt written
            notice to Customer before making the disclosure, unless prohibited
            from doing so by the legal or administrative process, and assist
            Customer to obtain where reasonably available an order protecting
            the Confidential Information from public disclosure. 7.6.4   
            Ownership. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms,
            VEROHIVE acknowledges that, as between the parties, all Confidential
            Information it receives from Customer, including all copies thereof
            in Recipient’s possession or control, in any media, is proprietary
            to and exclusively owned by Customer. Nothing in these Terms grants
            VEROHIVE any right, title or interest in or to any of the Customer’s
            Confidential Information. VEROHIVE’s incorporation of the disclosing
            party’s Confidential Information into any of its own materials will
            not render Confidential Information non-confidential. 8.        TERM
            AND TERMINATION 8.1       Termination – Site Visitors. A Site
            Visitor may terminate its use of the Site at any time by ceasing
            further use of the Site. VEROHIVE may terminate your use of the Site
            and deny you access to the Site in our sole discretion for any
            reason or no reason, including for violation of these Terms. 8.2
                  Term and Termination – Customers. 8.2.1    Suspension of
            Access to VEROHIVE Services. VEROHIVE may suspend any use of the
            VEROHIVE Services, remove any content or disable or terminate any
            Account or Authorized User that VEROHIVE reasonably and in good
            faith believes violates these Terms. VEROHIVE will use commercially
            reasonable efforts to notify you prior to any such suspension or
            disablement, unless VEROHIVE reasonably believes that: (a) it is
            prohibited from doing so under applicable law or under legal
            process, such as court or government administrative agency
            processes, orders, mandates, and the like; or (b) it is necessary to
            delay notice in order to prevent imminent harm to the VEROHIVE
            Services or a third party. Under circumstances where notice is
            delayed, VEROHIVE will provide the notice if and when the related
            restrictions in the previous sentence no longer apply. 8.2.2   
            Term. The period of effectiveness of these Terms (“Term”), with
            respect to VEROHIVE Services, begins on the date the Customer
            accepts it and continues until the Customer’s Subscription Plan
            expires or its use of the VEROHIVE Services ceases (including as a
            result of termination in accordance with this Section 8.2),
            whichever is later. 8.2.3    Subscription Term and Automatic
            Renewals. VEROHIVE’s Subscription Plans automatically renew unless
            otherwise noted. If you purchase a Subscription Plan you agree to
            pay the then-current applicable fee associated with the Subscription
            Plan and further agree and acknowledge that it will automatically
            renew, unless, prior to the end of the current period of
            effectiveness of the Subscription Plan (“Subscription Term”): (a)
            you terminate your Account; (b) you set your Account not to
            auto-renew by logging in to VEROHIVE Services or contacting us here:
            privacytos at verohive.com; (c) VEROHIVE declines to renew your
            Subscription Plan; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly
            terminated as expressly permitted herein. The Subscription Plan will
            automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the
            method you choose (“Renewal Term”). Promotional codes may only be
            used for your first Subscription Term. If you purchased your
            Subscription Plan with a promotional code, each time your
            Subscription Plan renews you will be charged the full annual billing
            amount. If your Subscription Plan is ever terminated for any reason,
            and you purchase another Subscription Plan, you shall not be
            eligible to use a promotional code. We reserve the right to modify,
            terminate, or otherwise amend the fees and features associated with
            your Subscription Plan. We may also recommend that you purchase a
            new Subscription Plan that is comparable to your previous
            Subscription Plan that is ending. Before we change the fees and
            charges in effect, or add new fees and charges, we will give you
            advance notice of at least thirty (30) days. If we provide you such
            advance notice, your continued use of the VEROHIVE Services after
            the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the
            changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new
            fees or features, you may terminate your Subscription Plan as
            described in Section 8.2.4. If you accept the new Subscription Plan,
            its terms and conditions with these Terms will apply in the Renewal
            Term and thereafter. 8.2.4    Termination by Customer. You may
            terminate your Account at any time upon ten (10) days’ advance
            written notice to VEROHIVE. If you wish to terminate, you must
            provide notice by contacting privacytos at verohive.com. If you
            purchased your Subscription Plan through an external service, such
            as an App Store, you must use the tools made available by those
            services to manage and/or terminate your Subscription Plan. Section
            7.2.2 notwithstanding, if a Customer terminates its annual
            Subscription Plan within the first thirty (30) days of the initial
            Subscription Term, it may submit a written request to VEROHIVE for a
            refund of the fees paid to VEROHIVE for the initial Subscription
            Term, which VEROHIVE will consider, without obligation, in good
            faith. VEROHIVE has no obligation to consider refund requests
            related to a termination of a Subscription Plan if the termination
            does not occur in the first thirty (30) days of the initial
            Subscription Term, or if there has been a violation of other Terms
            herein, or if records indicate substantial productive use took place
            during that period. 8.2.5    Default; Termination by VEROHIVE. A
            Customer will be in default of these Terms if: (a) it fails to
            timely pay any amount owed to us or an Affiliate of ours; (b) it or
            an Authorized User associated with its Account breaches any
            provision of these Terms or violates any published policy applicable
            to the VEROHIVE Services; (c) it is or becomes subject to any
            proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or similar laws; or (d) if, in
            our sole discretion, we believe that continued use of the VEROHIVE
            Services by the Customer (or its Authorized Users or signers)
            creates legal risk for VEROHIVE or presents a threat to the security
            of the VEROHIVE Services or VEROHIVE’s customers. If a Customer is
            in default, we may, without notice: (i) suspend its Account and use
            of the VEROHIVE Services; (ii) terminate its Account; (iii) charge
            reactivation fees in order to reactivate its Account; and (iv)
            pursue any other remedy available to us. A VEROHIVE “Affiliate”
            means any legal entity that Megahoot, LLC. owns, that owns VEROHIVE.
            or that is under common control with VEROHIVE, Inc.  A Customer
            “Affiliate” means any legal entity that Customer owns, that owns
            Customer or that is under common control with Customer. “Control”
            and “own” mean possessing greater than 50% interest in an entity or
            the right to direct the management of the entity. 8.2.6    Effect of
            Termination. If these Terms expires or are terminated for any
            reason: (a) Customer will pay to VEROHIVE any amounts that have
            accrued before, and remain unpaid as of, the date of the termination
            or expiration, including those for the billing cycle in which
            termination occurs; (b) any and all of Customer’s liabilities to
            VEROHIVE that have accrued before the effective date of the
            expiration or termination will survive; (c) licenses and use rights
            granted to Customer with respect to the Site and VEROHIVE Services
            and intellectual property will immediately terminate; (d) VEROHIVE’s
            obligation to provide any further services to Customer under these
            Terms will immediately terminate, except any such services that are
            expressly to be provided following expiration or termination of
            these Terms; and (e) the provisions of Section 3 (Usage and Access
            Rights), Section 4 (Ownership), Section 5.3 (Restrictions on Use of
            the Site), Section 5.4 (Compliance with Terms), Section 6 (Privacy),
            Section 7.2.2 (No Refunds), Section 7.2.7 (Benefit Programs),
            Section 7.2.8 (Tax Responsibility), Section 7.3 (Free Trial and
            Special Offers for VEROHIVE Services), Section 7.4 (Data), Section
            7.6 (Confidentiality), Section 8.2.6 (Effect of Termination),
            Section 9 (Warranties and Disclaimers), Section 10 (Indemnification
            Obligations), Section 11 (Limitations of Liability), and Section 12
            (General) will survive, as well as provisions designated to survive
            under any Service Schedules and accompanying attachments and
            Exhibits to these Terms.  9.      WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS THE

            WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM USE OF THE
            VEROHIVE SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, OR SITE.  THE VEROHIVE PARTIES
            MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS THAT VEROHIVE SERVICES,
            DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE PROVIDED WITH DUE
            SKILL, CARE AND DILIGENCE OR ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF
            THE VEROHIVE SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE CONTENT AND ASSUMES
            NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY: (i) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF
            CONTENT; (ii) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OF ANY NATURE
            WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF VEROHIVE
            SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE; (iii) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO
            OR USE OF OUR SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR

            TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA VEROHIVE SERVICES,
            DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE OR PASS
            ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ON BEHALF OF VEROHIVE TO ANY THIRD
            PARTY. BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
            LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED TO THE
            MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY AND FOR THE MINIMUM WARRANTY PERIOD
            ALLOWED BY THE MANDATORY APPLICABLE LAW. If you are a California
            resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code §1542, which says:
            “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
            not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing
            the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
            settlement with the debtor.” This release includes the criminal acts
            of others. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain
            warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for
            incidental or consequential damages such as in this Section 9 or
            below in Section 11. Accordingly, some of these limitations may not
            apply to you. If you are a New Jersey resident, or a resident of
            another state that permits the exclusion of these warranties and
            liabilities, then the limitations in Section 9 and Section 11
            specifically do apply to you. 10.     INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
            You will defend, indemnify, and hold us, our Affiliates, officers,
            directors, employees, suppliers, consultants, and agents harmless
            from any and all third-party claims, liability, damages, and costs
            (including, but not limited to, attorneys&#39; fees) arising from or
            related to, as applicable: (a) your access to and use of the Site;
            (b) violation of these Terms by you or your Account Administrator(s)
            or Authorized Users, as applicable; (c) infringement of any
            intellectual property or other right of any person or entity by you;
            (d) the nature and content of all Customer Data processed by the
            VEROHIVE Services; or (e)  any products or services purchased or
            obtained by you in connection with the Site. VEROHIVE retains the
            exclusive right to settle, compromise, and pay, without your prior
            consent, any and all claims or causes of action that are brought
            against us. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the
            exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are
            required to indemnify us and you agree to cooperate with our defense
            of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter in which we are
            named as a defendant and/or for which you have indemnity obligations
            without our prior written consent. We will use reasonable efforts to
            notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming
            aware of it. 11.     LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY 11.1     Disclaimer of
            Consequential Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
            CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS, VEROHIVE WILL NOT, UNDER ANY
            CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL,
            SPECIAL, COVER, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR
            RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THESE TERMS,
            INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST
            PROFITS, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, EVEN IF APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF
            SUCH LOSSES, AND WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE MADE BASED ON CONTRACT,
            TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. TO THE
            FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
            VEROHIVE PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
            INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
            RESULTING FROM ANY: (a) USE OF THE SITE, DOCUMENTATION, OR VEROHIVE
            SERVICES; (b) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (c)
            PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER
            RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE, DOCUMENTATION, OR
            VEROHIVE SERVICES; (d) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR
            SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR FINANCIAL
            INFORMATION STORED THEREIN; (e) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF
            TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR SERVERS; (f) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN
            HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE SITE,
            DOCUMENTATION, OR VEROHIVE SERVICES BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (g) ANY LOSS
            OF YOUR DATA OR CONTENT FROM THE SITE, DOCUMENTATION, OR VEROHIVE
            SERVICES; (h) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS
            OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF ANY
            CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE
            SITE, DOCUMENTATION, OR VEROHIVE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON
            WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
            THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE VEROHIVE PARTIES ARE ADVISED OF THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND/OR (i) THE DISCLOSURE OF
            INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS OR OUR PRIVACY POLICY. Some
            countries and jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion
            of consequential, direct, indirect, or other damages in contracts
            with consumers and to the extent you are a consumer the limitations
            or exclusions in this Section 11.1 may not apply to you. 11.2    
            Cap on Damages. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION
            ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE
            (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE
            FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON
            CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR
            EQUITABLE THEORY, WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO
            VEROHIVE FOR THE VEROHIVE SERVICE(S) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM UNDER
            THESE TERMS DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE
            OF THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, OR $100, WHICEVER IS
            GREATER. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM SHALL NOT ENLARGE THIS
            LIMIT. 11.3     Independent Allocations of Risk. Each provision of
            these Terms that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer
            of warranties, or exclusion of damages represents an agreed
            allocation of the risks of these Terms between the parties. This
            allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain
            between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and
            independent of all other provisions of these Terms, and each of
            these provisions will apply even if the warranties in these Terms
            have failed of their essential purpose. 11.4    Jurisdictional
            Limitations.  11.4.1  Because some states and jurisdictions do not
            allow limitation of liability in certain instances, portions of the
            above limitation may not apply to you. In that event, such
            exclusions and limitations shall apply to the maximum extent
            permitted by applicable mandatory law (and our liability shall be
            limited or excluded as permitted under mandatory applicable law). If
            you are a New Jersey resident, the limitations in Section 11
            specifically do apply to you. 11.4.2  VEROHIVE’s liability to you if
            you are domiciled in Germany is limited as described in Section 12.9
            below. 12.      GENERAL     12.1     Third Party Content. We may
            provide. VEROHIVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT ON THE INTERNET
            OR WEB PAGES THAT ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE SITE OR POSTS OF USER
            CONTENT. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or
            participation in promotions of, advertisers or partners found on or
            through the Site, including payment and delivery of related goods or
            services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or
            representations associated with such dealings, are solely between
            you and such advertiser or partner. You agree that we are not
            responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as
            the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of
            such advertisers or links to third-party web sites or resources on
            the Site. 12.2     Relationship. At all times, you and VEROHIVE are
            independent contractors, and are not the agents or representatives
            of the other. These Terms are not intended to create a joint
            venture, partnership, or franchise relationship between the
            parties. Non- parties do not benefit from and cannot enforce these
            Terms. There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. You
            must not represent to anyone that you are an agent of VEROHIVE or
            are otherwise authorized to bind or commit VEROHIVE in any way
            without VEROHIVE’s prior written authorization. 12.3     EXPORT
            RESTRICTIONS. You acknowledge that the Services, or portion thereof
            may be subject to the export control laws of the United States and
            other applicable country export control and trade sanctions laws
            (“Export Control and Sanctions Laws”). You and your End Users may
            not access, use, export, re-export, divert, transfer or disclose any
            portion of the Services or any related technical information or
            materials, directly or indirectly, in violation of any applicable
            export control or trade sanctions law or regulation. You represent
            and warrant that (i) You and your End Users are not citizens of, or
            located within, a country or territory that is subject to U.S. trade
            sanctions or other significant trade restrictions (including without
            limitation Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea) and that
            you and your End Users will not access or use the Services, or
            export, re-export, divert, or transfer the Services, in or to such
            countries or territories; (ii) You and your End Users are not
            identified on any U.S. government restricted party lists (including
            without limitation the U.S. Treasury Department’s List of Specially
            Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons and Foreign Sanctions
            Evaders List, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Parties List,
            Entity List, and Unverified List, and the U.S. Department of State
            proliferation-related lists); and (iii) that no Content created or
            submitted by you or your End Users is subject to any restriction on
            disclosure, transfer, download, export or re-export under the Export
            Control Laws. You are solely responsible for complying with the
            Export Control Laws and monitoring them for any modifications. 12.4
            NO HIGH RISK USE. The Services are not designed or licensed for use
            in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe controls, including
            without limitation operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft
            navigation/communication systems, air traffic control, and life
            support or weapons systems. The Services shall not be used for or in
            any HIGH RISK environment.  12.5     Assignability. You may not
            assign your rights or obligations under these Terms without
            VEROHIVE’s prior written consent. If consent is given, these Terms
            will bind your successors and assigns. Any attempt by you to
            transfer your rights, duties, or obligations under these Terms
            except as expressly provided in these Terms is void. VEROHIVE may
            freely assign its rights, duties, and obligations under these Terms.
            12.6      Notices. Except as otherwise permitted by these Terms, any
            notice required or permitted to be given in connection with the
            VEROHIVE Services will be effective only if it is in writing and
            sent using: (a) VEROHIVE Services; (b) by certified or registered
            mail; or (c) insured courier, to the appropriate party at the
            address set forth in Customer’s registration information or on the
            Site for VEROHIVE, with a copy, in the case of VEROHIVE, to
            privacypolicytos at verohive.com. Customer or VEROHIVE may change
            its address for receipt of notice by notice to the other party in
            accordance with this Section 12. Notices are deemed given upon
            receipt if delivered using VEROHIVE Services, two (2) business days
            following the date of mailing, or one (1) business day following
            delivery to a courier. 12.7      Force Majeure. Except for any
            payment obligations, neither you nor VEROHIVE will be liable for
            failure to perform any obligation under these Terms to the extent
            such failure is caused by a force majeure event (including acts of
            God, natural disasters, war, civil disturbance, action by
            governmental entity, strike, and other causes beyond the party’s
            reasonable control). The party affected by the force majeure event
            will provide notice to the other party within a commercially
            reasonable time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
            resume performance as soon as practicable. Obligations not performed
            due to a force majeure event will be performed as soon as reasonably
            possible when the force majeure event concludes. 12.8 INJUNCTIVE
            RELIEF. You acknowledge that any use of the Services contrary to
            this Agreement, or any transfer, sublicensing, copying or disclosure
            of technical information or materials related to the Services, may
            cause irreparable injury to VEROHIVE, its Affiliates, suppliers and
            any other party authorized by VEROHIVE to resell, distribute, or
            promote the Services (&quot;Resellers&quot;), and under such
            circumstances VEROHIVE, its Affiliates, suppliers and Resellers will
            be entitled to equitable relief, without posting bond or other
            security, including, but not limited to, preliminary and permanent
            injunctive relief. 12.9     Mandatory Arbitration, Waiver of Class
            Actions Applicable to Customers.  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION
            CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO
            FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. 12.7.1 You agree that these Terms affect
            interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the
            interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This
            Section 12.7 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any
            and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims
            arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between
            us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
            misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose
            before these Terms or any prior; and claims that may arise after the
            termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this
            broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual
            property as provided below. 12.7.2 Initial Dispute Resolution. Most
            disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration. If you have
            any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action
            you will contact us at privacypolicytos at verohive.com provide a
            brief, written description of the dispute and your contact
            information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an
            Account). Except for intellectual property, you and VEROHIVE agree
            to use their reasonable efforts to settle any dispute, claim,
            question, or disagreement directly through consultation with
            VEROHIVE, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either
            party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. 12.7.3 Arbitrator’s
            Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court
            or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes
            arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,
            enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including but not
            limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or
            voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration or the question
            of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered
            to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or
            in equity. The arbitrator&#39;s award shall be written and shall be
            binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court
            of competent jurisdiction. 12.7.4 Filing a Demand. To start an
            arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for
            Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount
            of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for
            Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (b) Send three copies of the Demand
            for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two
            Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco California 94111; and
            (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us
            at:privacypolicytos at verohive.com. 12.7.5 No Jury Trial. The
            parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration section,
            they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
            They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of
            arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to
            discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. 12.7.6
            Venue. Arbitration shall be initiated and take place in Delaware,
            United States, and you and VEROHIVE agree to submit to the personal
            jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Delaware in order to
            compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
            confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by
            the arbitrator. 12.7.7 Class Action Waiver. The parties further
            agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s
            respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or
            other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their
            right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU
            AND VEROHIVE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY
            IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
            MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any
            court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set
            forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or
            that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the
            arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void
            in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed
            to arbitrate disputes. 12.7.8 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual
            Property. Notwithstanding the parties&#39; decision to resolve all
            disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement
            actions, validity determinations, or claims arising from or relating
            to theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of intellectual property in
            any state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent
            and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights
            (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral
            rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity
            rights). 12.7.9 Survival. This Mandatory Arbitration, Waiver of
            Class Actions section shall survive any termination of your use of
            the Site. 12.8     Entire Terms. These Terms, which include the
            language and paragraphs preceding Section 1, are the final,
            complete, and exclusive expression of the agreement between you and
            VEROHIVE regarding the VEROHIVE Services provided under these
            Terms. These Terms supersede and the parties disclaim any reliance
            on previous oral and written communications (including any
            confidentiality agreements pertaining to the VEROHIVE Services under
            these Terms) with respect to the subject matter hereof and apply to
            the exclusion of any other terms that you seek to impose or
            incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or
            course of dealing. VEROHIVE hereby rejects any additional or
            conflicting terms appearing in a purchase order or any other
            ordering materials submitted by Customer and conditions assent
            solely based on these Terms and conditions of these Terms as offered
            by VEROHIVE. Except as explicitly permitted in these Terms, no
            modification or amendment of these Terms shall be effective unless
            it is in writing and signed by an authorized agent of the party
            against whom the modification or amendment is being asserted. In the
            event of an inconsistency or conflict, the order of precedence in
            descending order of control is as follows: (a) the Subscription
            Plan; (b) any attachments or appendix(ices) to the Service
            Schedule(s); (c) the Service Schedule; and (d) these Terms. 
            12.9   Governing Law &amp; Venue. These Terms will be interpreted,
            construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local
            laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., without reference to its
            choice of law rules to the contrary. For purposes of determining the
            governing law, you and VEROHIVE agree that VEROHIVE is the proponent
            of these Terms. Notwithstanding Customer’s and VEROHIVE’s agreement
            to mandatory arbitration, either party may seek any interim or
            preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction
            in Delaware, as necessary to protect the party&#39;s rights or
            property pending the completion of arbitration. Customer and
            VEROHIVE submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, any
            federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in
            Delaware, U.S.A. 12.10   Language and Translations. VEROHIVE may
            provide translations of these Terms or other terms or
            policies. Translations are provided for informational purposes and
            if there is an inconsistency or conflict between a translation and
            the English version, the English version will control.
            12.11 Waiver. The waiver by either you or VEROHIVE of any breach of
            any provision of these Terms does not waive any other breach. The
            failure of any party to these Terms to insist on strict performance
            of any covenant or obligation in accordance with these Terms will
            not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in
            the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of these
            Terms. 12.12   Severability. If any part of these Terms is found to
            be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of
            these Terms will remain in full force and effect. If any material
            limitation or restriction on the grant of any license to you under
            these Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the
            license will immediately terminate. 12.13 General Provisions. This
            Agreement embodies the entire understanding and agreement between
            the Parties respecting the subject matter of this Agreement and
            supersedes any and all prior understandings and agreements between
            the Parties respecting such subject matter, except that if you or
            your company have executed a separate written agreement or you have
            signed an order form referencing a separate agreement governing your
            use of the Services, then such agreement shall control to the extent
            that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the terms of
            such agreement. VEROHIVE may elect to change or supplement the terms
            of this Agreement from time to time at its sole discretion. VEROHIVE
            will exercise commercially reasonable business efforts to provide
            notice to you of any material changes to this Agreement. Within ten
            (10) business days of posting changes to this Agreement (or ten (10)
            business days from the date of notice, if such is provided), they
            will be binding on you. If you do not agree with the changes, You
            should discontinue using the Services. If you continue using the
            Services after such ten- business-day period, You will be deemed to
            have accepted the changes to the terms of this Agreement. In order
            to participate in certain Services, You may be notified that you are
            required to download software and/or agree to additional terms and
            conditions. Unless expressly set forth in such additional terms and
            conditions, those additional terms are hereby incorporated into this
            Agreement. This Agreement has been prepared in the English Language
            and such version shall be controlling in all respects and any
            non-English version of this Agreement is solely for accommodation
            purposes.
