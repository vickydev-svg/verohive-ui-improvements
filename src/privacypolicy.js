stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time 
the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” 
cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web 
browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the 
user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at 
the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not 
typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but 
personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information 
stored in and obtained from session cookies.</p>
